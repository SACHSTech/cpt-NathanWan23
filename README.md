I am using [the average alcohol consumption per capita (person) in a country](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-alcohol-consumption-per-capita-litres-of-pure-alcohol?tab=chart) as my data set. This data set shows the amount of pure alcohol people over the age of 15 in a given country consume on average in a given year. The reason why I selected this data is because alcohol consumption at a high level is a serious danger not only to the person drinking, but also to those around. Alcohol makes people more impuslive and violent. It is almost a given that when a lot of people are drunk there is bound to be a fight breaking out. Drinking also causing impared driving which has taken the lives of many innocent individuals. These are just some consequences for those around, alcohol consumption at a high level, is proven to cause kidney faliure. Kidney faliure is exteremely serious as the kidney is a vital organ in the human body. Without them, we die. I hope to shed some light on this data to show that this is a problem.
